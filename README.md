# Curriculum - first site

This is my first HTML and CSS project, creating my Curriculum Vitae (CV). This project was built during my study in the first modules of the course ["The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?src=sac&kw=the+complete+2023) by Angela Yu.

## Overview
### The project
The idea of this project is to build a personal page with author's CV information in order to apply and practice the first HTML and CSS knowledge obtained in the course.
I wrote my CV in Portuguese, my first language.
